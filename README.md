# Python-Project
The bike_sharing file contain an exploratory analysis to predict the number of trips taken on a given day in Minneapolis, Saint Paul and greater Minnesota. We will be taking the past 3 years data to help us with our prediction. We will also check if the number of trips depends on other factors like weather,membership type,type of day(Business vs holiday vs Weekend) etc. Best part of our analysis is we could walk in and check it out for ourselves how accurately did we predict.
